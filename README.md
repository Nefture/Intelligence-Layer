# Nefture
## Bringing Stellar to Institutional-Grade Portfolio Monitoring

"Offers real-time & historical Stellar portfolio tracking to help funds and users monitor risk and PnL with institutional precision."

## üìÑ Nefture x Stellar ‚Äì Technical Architecture

### Project Overview
Nefture is developing a comprehensive institutional-grade portfolio monitoring solution specifically designed for Stellar's ecosystem. Our architecture bridges the gap between traditional finance requirements and DeFi innovation by providing deep, granular visibility into portfolio performance, risk metrics, and asset allocation across Stellar's network.
The project transforms Stellar portfolio management from manual tracking to automated, institutional-grade monitoring with historical reconstruction capabilities. With a total budget of $91,000 USD allocated across 7 deliverables, the project spans from September 2025 to February 2026, bringing enterprise-level portfolio intelligence to Stellar.

### Integration with Nefture Architecture

This price oracle system directly implements **Layer 2: Normalization & Enrichment** of the Nefture architecture:

- **Custom Asset Pricer**: Prices any Stellar token based on liquidity pools
- **Price Oracle Integration**: Multi-source feeds with confidence scoring
- **Asset Classifier**: Automatic categorization of tokens and positions
- **Data Validation**: Outlier detection and quality assurance

The oracle provides the foundational pricing data that enables:
- Portfolio valuation and PnL calculations
- Risk metrics computation (VaR, Sharpe ratios)
- Performance attribution analysis
- Cross-chain asset pricing

### Quick Start

1. **Deploy Oracle Contract**:
   ```bash
   ./deploy-comprehensive.sh
   ```

2. **Start Data Feeder**:
   ```bash
   node oracle-data-feeder.js
   ```

3. **Access Dashboard**:
   Open `stellar-pricer.html` in your browser

### Configuration

Set environment variables for your deployment:
```bash
export STELLAR_NETWORK=testnet  # or mainnet
export CONTRACT_ID=your_contract_id
export ADMIN_SECRET_KEY=your_admin_secret_key
export UPDATE_INTERVAL=300  # seconds
```

This price oracle foundation enables the entire Nefture Intelligence Layer by providing accurate, real-time pricing data essential for institutional-grade portfolio monitoring and risk management.

### Technical Architecture
#### Four-Layer Architecture
Nefture's solution consists of four integrated layers designed for institutional precision:

**1. Direct Blockchain Data Layer**
The foundation layer extracts raw ledger data directly from Stellar's blockchain:
- On-Chain Indexer: Direct blockchain access capturing all transaction types with complete data fidelity
- Transaction Decoder: Comprehensive decoding of DeFi transactions
- Soroban Event Monitor: Real-time tracking of smart contract interactions and state changes
- Historical Reconstruction Engine: Complete portfolio state recreation from wallets genesis to present as well as liquidity pools and lending markets

**2. Normalization & Enrichment Layer**
The processing layer transforms raw blockchain data into institutional-grade analytics:
- Asset Classifier: Automatic categorization of tokens, LP positions, and derivative instruments
- Price Oracle Integration: Multi-source price feeds with confidence scoring and outlier detection
- Custom Asset Pricer: Price any tokens based on liquidity pools for accurate valuation
- Transaction Categorizer: Intelligent classification of swaps, deposits, withdrawals, and complex DeFi interactions
- Cross-Reference Engine: Linking related transactions for complete activity understanding

**3. Analytics & Risk Engine**
The intelligence layer computes institutional metrics and risk indicators:
- Performance Calculator: Time-weighted returns, money-weighted returns, and benchmark comparisons
- Risk Metrics Suite: APY, PnL, VaR, CVaR, Sharpe ratios, maximum drawdown, and correlation matrices
- Attribution Analysis: Performance attribution by asset, protocol, and strategy
- Scenario Engine: Stress testing and what-if analysis for portfolio positions

**4. Delivery & Integration Layer**
The presentation layer provides multiple access points for institutional users:
- Enterprise Dashboard: React-based interface with institutional-grade visualizations
- REST API: Programmatic access with OpenAPI specification for automated reporting
- Feeds: Real-time portfolio updates and alert streaming
- Export Suite: Regulatory-compliant reporting in multiple formats (CSV, JSON, PDF)

### Architecture Graph

### Implementation Details

#### Technical Stack
- TypeScript & Node.js 20: API layer, background queue workers, and webhook processing. 
- Soroban RPC: Contract calls and event ingestion, with stellar-sdk in TypeScript
- PostgreSQL: Primary transactional database for positions, ledgers, and historical records. 
- Redis: Low-latency caching for price data, recent positions, and API responses. 
- Apollo GraphQL: Unified query layer providing cross-chain, normalized portfolio data to clients. 
- Next.js: Frontend 

#### Data Pipeline Architecture

**Blockchain Synchronization**
Our indexer maintains perfect synchronization with Stellar's ledger through a sophisticated checkpoint and recovery system. The architecture implements parallel processing for historical backfill while maintaining real-time ingestion, ensuring zero data gaps even during high-throughput periods.

**Event Processing Framework**
Events flow through a multi-stage pipeline with built-in retry logic and dead letter queues. Each stage validates data integrity through cryptographic verification, ensuring institutional-grade data accuracy. 

**Database Architecture**
We implement a hybrid storage strategy combining hot storage for recent data (PostgreSQL) with cold storage for historical archives (S3/Parquet). This approach optimizes query performance while maintaining cost efficiency for multi-year historical analysis.

#### Analytics Engine Implementation

**Portfolio Reconstruction**
Our unique temporal database design allows point-in-time portfolio reconstruction at any historical moment. This enables accurate historical performance calculation, essential for institutional reporting and compliance requirements.

**Risk Modeling**
The risk engine employs factor models adapted from traditional finance, including multi-factor attribution and stress testing scenarios specific to DeFi risks such as impermanent loss, smart contract risk, and liquidity risk.

**Performance Metrics**
Beyond simple ROI and APY, we calculate institutional metrics including time-weighted returns, money-weighted returns, risk-adjusted returns, and benchmark-relative performance - all essential for professional portfolio management.

#### Cross-Chain Architecture

**Unified Data Model**
Stellar data seamlessly integrates with existing EVM chain support (Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base) through our normalized data model. Users see unified portfolio views across all supported chains.

**Cross-Chain Analytics**
Performance and risk metrics aggregate across chains, providing true portfolio-level insights. Correlation analysis identifies cross-chain dependencies and risks.
